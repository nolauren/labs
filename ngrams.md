#Word Counts

In Moretti's *Graphs, Maps, and Trees*,  we saw examples of the rise and fall of particular novels by
nation. He then looked at genres within British Literature over time. If we take any corpus of texts,
there are often similar patterns we can see over time. One way to explore these patterns is to look
at the relative frequency of words. For example, if we were using Moretti's corpus, we would look
what is written in each novel (i.e. the words) as opposed to the data about each novel (i.e. number
of books sold, genre). 

Since we don't have Moretti's corpus, we need to use a different corpus to do word counts. 
We will use Google's n-gram viewer. What's an n-gram? It's a generalization from a single word
to a sequence of n words. This is helpful because it will allow us to look up sequences of words
such as "United States".


# Google Ngrams

Go to [Google Ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams).


* Type in "vegetarian".
 * What do you notice? How might we account for this?

* Now add the word "vegan". So type "vegetarian, vegan".

* Let's turn to military/political history.
 * Type in "the great war, the world war, world war I". Select "case insensative" and the date range "1900 and 2000".
 * What do you notice? How might we account for this?
 * Adjust the "smoothing" option as you wish. What happens?


* And to be crude. Type the word "fuck" and expand the range to between 1600 and 2000.
 * Where is the peak? Let's explore further.
 * Click on the corresponding years to the peak. 
 * Look at the words in context on the search page. 
 * How do we account for what we see?
 
* Play around! For more on other options, see [Google N-gram info](https://books.google.com/ngrams/info). 

* So, I've done some n-grams. Now I want to use my results. Are there any challenges with this? Concerns? Questions? What do we need to pay attention to?
